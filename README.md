# CSE 241 - Database Systems & Applications

Semester-long project for Lehigh's Spring 2022 CSE 241 course. The goal is to
design a robust database along with separate interfaces for different access
levels at a fictional company, NUMA.

Northside Uncommons Management of Apartments (NUMA)

Dev Notes:

- When a user logins to the system, the system should automatically create a view for that user that only represents the info that they can see. All queries will be used on that
