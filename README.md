# CSE 241 - Database Systems & Applications

Semester-long project for Lehigh's Spring 2022 CSE 241 course. The goal is to
design a robust database along with separate interfaces for different access
levels at a fictional company, Northside Uncommons Management of Apartments (NUMA).

## Directory Structure

```dir
.
├── setup.sql                   # Driver script to setup the database relations
├── shutdown.sql                # Script to bring down the entire database
├── triggers/                   # Holds the individual trigger scripts
├── mock/                       # CSV files containing mock data for populating the database
├── Schema.pdf                  # Database Schema Diagram
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
└── README.md                   # You're reading me!
```

> Mock data found in `mock` is generated by [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and imported into Oracle SQL Developer using the built-in wizard

## Dev Notes

- When a user logins to the system, the system should automatically create a view for that user that only represents the info that they can see. All queries will be used on that
